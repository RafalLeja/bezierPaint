# bezierPaint

## Program for creating letters with bezier curves

Usage:
 * To add points, select the "Add point" option from the toolbar on the right side and click anywhere on the canvas.
 * Moving, duplicating, and deleting points works in a similar way, as the program selects the point closest to the clicked location.
 * You can add new curves and change their names (remember that two curves cannot have the same name).
 * The top toolbar's "Edit" menu provides options such as grid, background, italics, and curve merging.
 * The "File" menu allows you to save or load your progress.
